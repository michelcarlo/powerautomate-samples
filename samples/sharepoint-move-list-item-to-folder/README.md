# Move SharePoint List Item to Folder

## Summary

Moves a SharePoint list item to a folder, based on a field value. Useful for cases where folders are enabled in a list, and the forms were customised with Canvas Apps, as the items are always created in the root of the list.

This flow assumes the folders already exist.

For example if you have a choice field named Continents with the values: Africa, North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Oceania, Asia

And the same folders created & used this choice field as the value for the variable 'MoveToFolderName', when you add or edit an item with 'Europe' as value for the field, it will be moved to the folder named 'Europe' by the Flow.
